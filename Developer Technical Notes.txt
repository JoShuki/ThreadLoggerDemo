Developer Technical Notes for TheardLoggerDemo

Description
-----------
The application TheardLoggerDemo initializes the log file /log/out.txt and and writes lines to it concurrently using 10 threads.
Each thread writes 10 entries to the log file
The threads access the log file and a log file entry counter.   
    
Access to those two is synchronized using a lock to ensure thread-safe writing.    
The main thread waits for all threads to finish before prompting the user to exit.
    
To avoid the application from crashing, Unhandled exception are caught in Program.cs->CurrentDomainUnhandledException() which:
    A) Display an error message to the user.
    B) Terminate any running threads.
    C) Properly exits the application.

Design Notes
------------
Choice of creating and starting threads instead of Parallel.Invoke 
- gets the threads started and running without any delays
- The threads all start within 1 millisecond of each other.

Choice of using threads instead of tasks 
- workload is light and threads are far more lightweight than tasks.
- there is only need for thread synchronized when exiting the application, no need for the additional functionality tasks have.
